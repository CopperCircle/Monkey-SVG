Monkey-SVG
==========

Hi, here is a basic SVG parser/renderer. My plan was to look at being able to load SVG's, scale them to the size needed and then create an image atlas for the app to use. For certain types of graphics/UI elements this could be great with all the different device resolutions/sizes. It could also be used to create fonts at any size.

Anyway I threw this together and have not had time to take it any further, not all SVG commands have been implemented and there is no triangulation yet so it will only look correct on HTML5.
I have also only tried it with SVG v1.1 files created with Adobe Illustrator.

It requires SKN3's latest XML module and also contains various code snippets from the monkey forums (thanks to those who's code is used).

If anyone wants to help flesh it out, please do :)
